# codeAssignment
Here i am including my code assignment 


Firstly i am splitting the Animals into Birds and Animals,then further split Birds based on functionality. 


After that i do split and test each and individual and create a document for that.


In section A:

--> Implement Sing() method for the Bird Model object.

--> Implement 2 Special Kinds of Birds named as Duck and Chicken making with there special sounds and features.

--> Create a Model for Rooster and implement sing() method with there special sound.

     while created i solved few questions and given results like:
     
     1. Implement the rooster sings   like “Cock-a-doodle-doo” .
     2. Rooster related to chicken :
         A rooster is a male chicken and is also known as a cock. So in usual terms, 
         a male chicken is a rooster and a female chicken is a hen.
         
 --> create and Implement new Model for Parrot that will lives and near to Cat,Dog,Rooster and Duck.
 
 In section B:
 
 --> Create a model for Fish object which has implemented only one method as swim() .
 
 --> Create and Implement 3 specializations of fishes like Shark , clown fish and Dolphin with their features like 
 
      * Size
      * colour
      * Behaviour
      
 In Section D:
   Creating 2 more Models that will Implement from Animals and Birds Interface
   which are Butterflies and Caterpillars having fly() an walk() methods.
 In section E:
     find a count of Indivdual based on methods of those entire Animals:
     
a. how many of these animals can fly : 3(Duck, Parrot,Butterfly)
b. how many of these animals can walk: 1(Caterpillar)
c. how many of these animals can sing: 4(Duck,Chicken,Parrot,Roaster)
d. how many of these animals can swim:4(Fish,Shark,Clown Fish,Dolphin).

Additional i implement Rooster Speaks/sings  with other Languages along with Native Language.
